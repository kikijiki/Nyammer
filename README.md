Nyammer
=======

Yammer chat and notification client that runs on AIR.

* Real time notifications for new messages.
* One‐on‐one and group messages.
* Subscribe to multiple networks.
* Thread list for each network.

Probably broken since the yammer API changes.

Note:
To be able to use the auto-update function the server settings must be updated.
